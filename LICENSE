Retention of Rights
Crucially, this partial open-source release & DLC download under the MIT License does not constitute a transfer of ownership or a relinquishment of any intellectual property rights related to the bio-Neural.ai CORE & enabling technologies for the NM-SRN framework, its underlying architecture, concepts, documentation, research, logos, branding, or any source code not explicitly included in this release. Ava Billions and Chris Knight (bio-neural.ai) retain all rights, title, and interest in these elements. The MIT License applies only to the specific code and documentation explicitly released within each “the ThinkSpace PROJECT” tier and downloadable content (DLC). Future versions, enhancements, and complete implementations of the NM-SRN framework remain the exclusive property of Ava Billions and Chris Knight.
